            <h1 className='text-3xl'>Difference between SQL and NoSQL?</h1>
            <p>Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

Structure: SQL databases are structured, while NoSQL databases are generally unstructured.

Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means they can handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. SQL databases are designed to scale vertically, which means that they can handle increasing data volumes by adding more processing power, storage, and memory.

Data modeling: NoSQL databases allow for more flexible data modeling, while SQL databases have a more rigid structure.

Querying: SQL databases use SQL to query data, while NoSQL databases use APIs or query languages specific to their data model.

Transactions: SQL databases support ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensure data consistency and integrity. NoSQL databases do not always support ACID transactions, but they often provide eventual consistency, which means that data will eventually become consistent across all nodes in the database.</p>

<h1 className='text-3xl'>What is JWT, and how does it work?</h1>
<p>JWT stands for JSON Web Token, which is an open standard for securely transmitting information as a JSON object between parties. JWT is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header and payload are base64 encoded JSON strings, while the signature is used to verify the authenticity of the JWT.

The header contains information about the algorithm used to sign the token, while the payload contains the data that needs to be transmitted securely. The payload can include information such as user ID, roles, permissions, and expiration time.

To generate a JWT, the server takes the header and payload, signs them using a secret key, and sends the resulting token to the client. The client can then include the token in subsequent requests to the server to authenticate and authorize the user.

When the server receives a JWT, it first verifies the signature to ensure that the token has not been tampered with. If the signature is valid, the server decodes the payload to retrieve the user data and validate the expiration time. If the payload is valid, the server grants access to the requested resource.

JWT has several benefits, including being stateless, meaning that the server does not need to keep track of user sessions, and being easy to use across multiple platforms and languages. Additionally, JWT can be used with various authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth and OpenID Connect.</p>

<h1 className='text-3xl'>What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?</h1>
        <p>JavaScript and Node.js are two different things, although they share some similarities since Node.js is built on top of JavaScript.

JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive web pages and browser-based applications. It is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs on the client's browser, and can manipulate the HTML and CSS on the page to provide dynamic user interfaces and respond to user actions.

Node.js, on the other hand, is a server-side runtime environment built on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows JavaScript to be run on the server-side, outside of the browser environment, and provides a way to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which enables it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Here are some key differences between JavaScript and Node.js:

    Environment: JavaScript runs on the client-side within a browser environment, while Node.js runs on the server-side.

    Use cases: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, while Node.js is used for server-side scripting, building web applications, APIs, and command-line tools.

    Libraries and modules: JavaScript has a vast range of libraries and modules designed for the browser environment, while Node.js has a different set of libraries and modules designed for server-side development.

    API: JavaScript provides the Document Object Model (DOM) API for interacting with web pages, while Node.js provides the Node.js API for server-side development.

    Architecture: JavaScript is typically used in a single-threaded environment, while Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that enables it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Overall, while JavaScript is used for client-side scripting and browser-based applications, Node.js is used for server-side development, building web applications, APIs, and command-line tools.</p>



            
            <h1 className='text-3xl'>How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?</h1>
            <p>Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which enables it to handle multiple requests at the same time efficiently.

When a Node.js server receives a request, it places the request on an event queue and continues to process other requests. Node.js then uses an event loop to check the event queue for new events and execute the associated callbacks.

Since Node.js does not block the event loop for any particular request, it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without causing a delay or blocking other requests. Node.js uses asynchronous callbacks to handle I/O operations, such as reading from a file or making a network request, without blocking the event loop.

Furthermore, Node.js provides a set of built-in modules, such as the Cluster module and the Child Process module, that enable it to leverage multi-core CPUs and distribute requests across multiple processes. This allows Node.js to handle even more requests at the same time and improve performance.

In summary, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model and asynchronous callbacks to efficiently handle multiple requests at the same time without causing a delay or blocking other requests. It also provides built-in modules for scaling to multiple processes, further improving performance.</p>
